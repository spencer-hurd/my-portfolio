            Welcome to my website! I'm Spencer Hurd, a full stack software
            developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions to
            complex problems. My background in music instruction and band
            directing has given me a unique set of skillsâ€”including creative
            problem-solving, thinking outside the box, strong communication and
            collaboration skills, detail-oriented design, and a strong work
            ethic. With the knowledge gained from a 12-week bootcamp immersive
            at the University of Texas at Dallas, powered by Fullstack Academy,
            I'm eager to start a career in web development and use my newfound
            skills to make impactful projects.
