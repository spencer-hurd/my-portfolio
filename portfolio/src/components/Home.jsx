            <hr/>
            <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Spencer Hurd, a full stack software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions to complex problems. My background in music instruction and band directing has given me a unique set of skillsâ€”including creative problem-solving, thinking outside the box, strong communication and collaboration skills, detail-oriented design, and a strong work ethic. With the knowledge gained from a 12-week bootcamp immersive at the University of Texas at Dallas, powered by Fullstack Academy, I'm eager to start a career in web development and use my newfound skills to make impactful projects.</p>
